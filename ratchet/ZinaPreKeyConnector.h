     * According to the optimized pre-key mechanism the party who requested the pre-key bundle
     * takes the Alice Axolotl role.
     * 
     * Because of requested pre-key bundle Alice knows Bob's identity key and has one of his
     * pre-keys including the id of that pre-key. Alice uses this to perform the following steps:
     * 
     * - generate an own pre-key (A0) and uses this together with Bob's identity and pre-key (B, B0)
     *   to compute the master secret.
     * - Alice also sends the first message, thus she creates the first ratchet keys. Because of
     *   the optimization she can use Bob's B0 to create the first ratchet.
     * - encrypts the message
     * - Alice creates a message to Bob which includes her identity key, her generated pre-key,
     *   the new ratchet key and the message data itself.
     * 
     * This function performs the master secret computation and generation of Alice's pre-key (A0).
